# About
Hi! This was my first discord bot, it was called Uno Reverse, I started my developing from that!

# Modules/libraries
This bot is built with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

# Requirements
All you need is a bot token which can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

# About me
I recently stopped coding for bots, I now do other stuff, right I have a bot and I update is day by day, but I work on other stuff on JavaScript more than my bot.

My bot's invite link: [Mikio](https://bit.ly/invmikio)
My bot's support server: [Mikio's Wonderland](https://bit.ly/supportmikio)
Another server I love: [Uno Reverse](https://discord.gg/nou)

# How to setup
You can setup the config.json file with your bot's token and prefix!
